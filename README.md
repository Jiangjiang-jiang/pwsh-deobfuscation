# Powershell Deobfuscator

This is an optimized Python implementation of [Invoke-Deobfuscation](Invoke-Deobfuscation: AST-Based and Semantics-Preserving Deobfuscation for PowerShell Scripts), an AST-based and semantics-preserving deobfuscation technique for PowerShell scripts.

For subsequent work, please see [PowerPeel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04027), which proposes a dynamic, instruction-level deobfuscation approach.
